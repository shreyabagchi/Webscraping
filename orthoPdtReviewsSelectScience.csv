Unit confirmation is extremely handy.  It can be used as a Stat instrument, but with the inability to retrieve the sample while it's being processed I would not recommend it be used in a critical care situation such as a trauma.  It is capable of running panels on positive antibody screens. However, panels can not be run at the same time as types and screens.  It is a 'set it and forget it' analyzer for the most part so it can prove useful in understaffed labs where technologists need to cover multiple departments.
